Welcome to Kubernetes documentation!
===================================

**Kubernetes Guide** Kubernetes (commonly abbreviated K8s) is an open-source container orchestration system for automating
software deployment, scaling, and management.[3][4] Originally designed by Google, the project is now maintained by the
Cloud Native Computing Foundation. The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning 'helmsman' or 'pilot'. Kubernetes is often abbreviated as K8s,
counting the eight letters between the K and the s (a numeronym).

Kubernetes works with containerd and CRI-O. Its suitability for running and managing large cloud-native workloads has led
to widespread adoption of it in the data center. There are multiple distributions of this platform â€“ from ISVs as well as
hosted-on cloud offerings from all the major public cloud vendors.
